Operating System: An OS is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.
Types of OS :-
1.	Desktop OS – Microsoft windows, macOS, linux such as ubuntu
2.	Server OD – windows server, linux distributions like centOS, RHEL
3.	Mobile OS – Android, iOS, Windows mobile
4.	Embedded OS – Routers, smart TVs, automobiles, home appliances
5.	Real-time OS(RTOS) – medical equipment, car ECUs, aerospace, defence, network firewalls, home security systems
Linux Distributions
1.	Ubuntu
2.	Fedora
3.	Debian
4.	RHEL
5.	CentOS
6.	Arch Linux
7.	openSUSE
8.	linux mint
9.	gentoo linux
10.	slackware
11.	alpine linux

Install Oracle Virtualbox to use linux systems - https://www.virtualbox.org/
Filesystem – used by an OS to manage files. The system controls how data is saved or retrieved.
/boot – contains file that is used by the boot loader
/root – root user home directory
/dev – system devices(eg. Disk,cdrom,speakers etc)
/etc – configuration files
/bin - /usr/bin – everyday user commands
/sbin - /usr/sbin – system/filesystem commands
/opt – optional add on applications(not part of OS apps)
/proc – running processes(only exist in memory)
/lib - /usr/lib – C programming lib files needed by commands and apps
/tmp - directory for temporary files
/hom – directory for user
/var – system logs
/run – system daemons that start very early to store temporary runtime files like PID files
/mnt – to mount external filesystem
/media – for cdrom mounts

cd – change directory
pwd – print working directory
ls – list
whoami
ls -l
cd ..
su - -> become root user
ls -lrt
Type of files
drwx-xr-x – directory
lrwxrwxrwx – link
-rw-w-r-- - file
- ->regular file
D -> directory
l –> link
c –> special file or device file
p –> named pipe
b –> block device
change password – passwd

FILE SYSTEM PATHS
Absolute Path – begins with /– cd /var/log
Relative Path – does not begin with /, identifies a location relative to your current position – cd /var , cd log

Creating files
touch filename -can create multiple files ( touch filename1 filename2)
cp filename  filename1
vi 
creating directories
mkdir foldername foldername1
copy directory – cp -r sourcefolder destinationfolder

sudo -i - root user
mkdir ops devops
touch devops{1..10}.txt -> creates 10 files
copy directory - cp -r source destination
move files/directories – mv ops /dev , mv *.txt textdir/
mkdir testdir{1..5}
mkdir -p /opt/ops/dev/devops/test
cat /etc/os-release

vi command mode –
gg – to go to the beginning of the page
G – to go to end of the page
w – to move the cursor forward, word by word
b - to move the cursor backward, word by word
nw - to move the cursor forward to n words(5W)
nb – to move the cursor backward to n words(5B)
u – to undo last change(word)
U – to undo the previous changes(entire line)
Ctrl+R – to redo the changes
yy – to copy a line
nyy – to copy n lines(4yy)
dd – cut the line
ndd – delete n number of lines
p – to paste line below the cursor position
P – to paste line above the cursor position
dw – to delete the word letter by letter(like backspace)
x – to delete the word letter by letter(like del key)
ESC+:se nu – shows numbers in the file(set numbers)
/word – to search for a word in vi editor

File Types
ls -l – long listing
ls -lt – sort according to time stamp
ls -ltr – reverse the sort
Hyphen(-) – regular file
d – directory
c – character file
b – block file
l – link (symbolic link file)
ln -s dest source
ctrl+d to exit / exit – same

history
to check the filetype – file <filepath>

Filters
grep word filename – searches word in file
grep -i firewall filename – ignore case sensitivity
grep -i word < filename -input redirection
grep -i word * - searches in current working directory
grep -iR word * - to search inside the sub directory as well
grep -R word /etc/*
grep -vi word filename – does not show anything related to word and shows the remaining, reverse search
less filename – can search for words and quit using q, can use up and down arrows
more filename – enter to read more
head -2 filename – shows first two lines of the file
tail -2 filename – last two lines of the file
tail -f filename – shows dynamic content of the file
/var/log – log files of the system
cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd – delimiter(d),Column1(f1) – prints column 1 
if there is no delimiter we can use awk
awk -F’:’ ‘{print $1}’ /etc/passwd – prints the first column
Esc+:%s/word/replacementword – replaces all word with replacementword in a line
Esc+:%s/word/replacementword/g – replace globally(g)
Esc+:%s/word//g – replace with nothing
sed ‘s/word/replacementword/g’ filename – will just print on screen will not make any changes to file
sed -i ‘s/word/replacementword/g’ filename – will change the word in file

Redirections
Redirection is a process where we can copy the output of any command(s), file(s) into a new file. There are two ways of redirecting the output into a file using > or >> filename after the command.
uptime > /tmp/sysinfo.txt
ls > /tmp/sysinfo.txt – store the values present in current working directory
uptime >> /tmp/sysinfo.txt – to append the content to previous values
free -m – memory utilisation
df -h – hard disk utilisation
freeee -m 2>> /tmp/error.log – redirect error to log file, 2 is for standard error
free -m 1>> /tmp/error.log – 1 is for standard output
free -m &>> /tmp/error.log – redirect any output to file
wc -l /etc/passwd – counts line numbers
ls | wc -l – ls output goes as input to right hand side command – and prints the number of files
ls | grep host – all file names that start with host
tail -20 /var/log/messages | grep -i vagrant
free -m | grep Mem
ls -l | head – first ten files
ls -l | tail – last ten files
find /etc -name host*
locate host

Users & Groups
To control access to files and resources
id username – gives info about the user
Users password is stored(encrypted) in /etc/shadow file.
/etc/passwd
/etc/group
useradd jenkins
groupadd devops
usermod -aG devops jenkins – adding jenkins user to devops group
passwd jenkins – can be done as root user , setting password
lsof -u username – lists all files opened by the user
userdel username – delete a user
userdel -r username – delete along with home directory
groupdel groupname

Permissions
User group others
-rwxr-xr-x – read write execute permissions
- -> filetype
useradd
groupadd
chown -R ansible:devops /opt
chmod o-r /opt - > remove read permission for others
chmod g+r /opt -> add read permission for group
u – user, g – group, o – others 
4- read, 2-write, 1 -execute
chmod 777 filename – full permissions

Sudo
sudo -i
/etc/sudoers - Only user in /etc/sudoers file or /etc/sudoers.d dir can use sudo -i command to switch to root user

Package management
rpm -qa – list all rpm packages in the system
arch / uname -m - to find arch of the system 
curl link -o filename/outputfile(.rpm) / wget url– to download
rpm -ivh filename(.rpm) – to install
rpm -qa | grep telnet
rpm -e filename(.rpm) – to remove the package
yum install httpd/ dnf install httpd 
dnf remove httpd
dnf install httpd -y – installs without asking

Services
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl restart httpd
reload/status/
systemctl is-active httpd – to check the status
systemctl is-enabled httpd – checks if the file is enabled

Processes
top – shows dynamic process based on cpu and ram, will get sorted based on cpu utilisation, q quit
ps aux – similar to top command
ps -ef | grep httpd | grep -v ‘grep’ – do not show grep and show the process running for httpd
kill / kill -9 processid – to stop the process, -9 for forcefull
 ps -ef | grep httpd | grep -v ‘grep’ | awk ‘{print $2}’ – awk prints the second column
ps -ef | grep httpd | grep -v ‘grep’ | awk ‘{print $2}’ | xargs kill -9 – executes a particular command

Archiving
tar -czvf jenkins.tar.gz directoryname/path – create, compress, verbose, file – create a tar file
tar -xzvf jenkins.tar.gz – extract the tar
zip -r httpd.zip jenkins – archive a file
unzip httpd.zip – unzip an archive

UBUNTU COMMANDS – based on Debian architecture
adduser devops
export EDITOR=vim – normally used is nano but to make it vim use export
dpkg -i filename.deb – install in ubuntu
apt install apache2
apt upgrade
apt remove apache2
apt purge apache – clean uninstall
